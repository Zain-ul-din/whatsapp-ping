WhatsApp Ping üîî</h1>
</div>

Catching messages on Gmail from clients always has me running late, and checking it over and over can be a real drag. That's why I created `whatsapp ping`! It lets me ping myself on WhatsApp using a webhook.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Zain-ul-din/whatsapp-ping)

### Usage

clone or fork the repo and install all dependencies using your favorite package manager. In my case, i'm using `pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm i
```

**Prepare environment variables:**

you need two env's to make this work

```env
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
MONGO_URL=your_url
```

We use `api-key` for authentication you can use any key you like to use but we recommend using strong key that is not vulnerable to `brute-force` attack.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 256
```

To run this bot in a serverless environment, we use MongoDB to manage the authentication state.

You can Get the MongoDB URL for free from their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/).

```js
mongodb+srv://<user_name>:<password>@cluster0.usggwa4.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**start the server using the following command:**

```bash
pnpm dev # start development server
OR
pnpm start # start server in production
```

After starting the server, it will print QR code in the terminal scan it using your phone to connect whatsapp.

### ‚öì Web Hook Usage

Next use web hook as following to send a message,

```c
curl -X POST localhost:8080/ping \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY"
    -d '{
        "message": "hello world",
        "numbers": ["123456789012"]
    }'
```

using js,

```js
fetch("http://localhost:8080/ping", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: "hey",
    numbers: ["<country_code_without_plus><...number>"]
  })
})
  .then((res) => res.text())
  .then((res) => console.log(res));
```

### Caveats

```diff
- If you plan to deploy this project, it currently works only on VPS and not in a serverless environment. This means you will not be able to deploy it to the Vercel or other serverless providers.
+ We just added support for serverless deployment https://github.com/Zain-ul-din/whatsapp-ping/issues/2
