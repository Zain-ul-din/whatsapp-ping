## WhatApp Ping üîî

Catching messages on Gmail from clients always has me running late, and checking it over and over can be a real drag. That's why I created `whatsapp ping`! It lets me ping myself on WhatsApp using a webhook.

### Usage

clone or fork the repo and install all dependencies using your favorite package manager. In my case, i'm using `pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm i
```

Prepare environment variables,

We use `api-key` for authentication you can use any key you like to use but we recommend using strong key that is not vulnerable to `brute-force` attack.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 256
```

start the server using following command,

```bash
pnpm dev # start development server
OR
pnpm start # start server in production
```

After starting the server, it will print QR code in the terminal scan it using your phone to connect whatsapp.

Next use web hook as following to send a message,

```c
curl localhost:8080/ping \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY"
    -d '{
        "message": "hello world",
        "number": "123456789012"
    }'
```

## Caveats

If you plan to deploy this project, it currently works only on VPS and not in a serverless environment. This means you will not be able to deploy it to the Vercel or other serverless providers.
